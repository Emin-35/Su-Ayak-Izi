# SU AYAK İZİ

Water scarcity is a pressing global concern, that calls for innovative approaches to encourage sustainable water consumption. This thesis introduces ”Su Ayak İzi,” a mobile application that is intended for precise tracking and evaluation of water consumption of individuals. “Su Ayak İzi” determines user routines of water usage by asking related questions during registration process. This leads to measuring water use in terms of volume and frequency across a range of activities that people do in their daily life, such as showering, laundry, dishwashing, and handwashing. The collected data establishes a comprehensive profile, enabling users to visualize, understand and evaluate their consumption patterns, then behave accordingly.
However, the impact of ”Su Ayak İzi” not only goes beyond tracking the water usage but also aligns with a broader objective in accordance with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, specifically focusing on the aim of “clean water and sanitation”. The application aims to promote a collective awareness among users, encouraging a dedication to sustainable water usage for the improvement of our environment and future generations.
This thesis presents how this mobile application, “Su Ayak  İzi”, was designed, built, and tested to obtain its strength/effectiveness in encouraging water-conscious behaviors of humans. Considering the precise analysis and user feedback, this study contributes insights into the potential impact of technology in advancing sustainable practices, particularly in the matter of water consumption.


## Features
-Customized Water Use Monitoring:
Users are able to track and record how much water they use each day for a variety of tasks, including washing dishes, taking showers, and doing laundry.

-User-Friendly Registration: During the registration process, the app asks a series of questions to gather initial water usage routines, which creates a baseline for each user.

-Evaluation and Visualization: By giving consumers a clear picture of consumption trends, this tool enables them to better understand and manage their water use.

-Community Engagement: By comparing user consumption patterns, this approach promotes a community-driven strategy for water conservation.

-Water Reminder: By sending notifications/alerts according to the frequency determined by the user, tracking and reminding the amount of water drunk will be possible.


## Tools and Technologies

While developing Su Ayak İzi mobile application following tools are used for designing, coding, versioning and testing:

Google Store is selected for the Android platform over IOS Google Store is selected because it is faster to release applications and cheaper compared to IOS. Also, more people use Android so this can lead to quickly connecting with people.
From different options such as Flutter, IntelliJ, AIDE, Android Studio, and more, Android Studio is selected by the teammates, As a team we already knew how to use Android Studio and we’re currently taking an Android Studio class, are the main reasons for this decision.
For the application language, Java language is selected, because for our education life, we used Java language. Also, Kotlin was the next option but because it is the lighter version of Java and it would take time to learn, Java was the agreed decision.
Canva and Figma for our UI/UX design are used because they’re free tools for usage, have a user-friendly interface and there are free non-copyrighted icons, fonts, and crafts, from the community.

MySQL or SQLite for our database is currently being used for this application. These databases are already known by us and SQLite is a lightweight design of MySQL also it is already implemented in Android Studio. which means we do not need to download or re-learn anything. But if this project gets bigger and we need more space or can not handle our data, we are planning to use MondoDB’s Realm database which provides free cloud service for our data which would take the stress from the server, also it’s an open source project that supports Java.
For the backend and for the server side, the Node.js tool is planned to be used. Other options were Django or Laravel but we already knew Node.js and it’s a free open-source server-side application
And lastly, for testing the application, JUnit which is the only framework will be used. It is a free testing framework that supports Java language and it is preferably used for Android applications.
